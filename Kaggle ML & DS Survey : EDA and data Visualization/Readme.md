The Survey was conducted in the form of a questionaire consisting of 50 question. This survey gives the idea about the the popular platform, libraries, programming languages etc in Machine Learning and Data Science. It also provide a glimpse about demographic about the participants , their roles in industry and how they are making use of Data Science, thus making this dataset interesting to explore.


###### The notebook deeply explores (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs).
